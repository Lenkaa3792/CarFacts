<p>Automobiles are quite the wonder. For thousands of years, people relied on horses or their own two feet for traveling. As the old English proverb says, “necessity is the mother of invention”, and there was definitely a necessity for other means of travel for going further and faster.

Did you know that, when vehicles were first introduced in 1886, few families could afford them and ownership was considered a luxury? Today, there are 1.4 billion cars—that’s about one car for every seven people!

Fasten your seatbelts and check out more interesting car facts. Save these fun facts for your next trivia night or your next road trip and have some fun as you cruise down the highway.</p>

            <p></p>A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people rather than goods. Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. <br>  <br></p>

<div class="content"><p>Automobiles are quite the wonder. For thousands of years, people relied on horses or their own two feet for traveling. As the old English proverb says, “necessity is the mother of invention”, and there was definitely a necessity for other means of travel for going further and faster.

Did you know that, when vehicles were first introduced in 1886, few families could afford them and ownership was considered a luxury? Today, there are 1.4 billion cars—that’s about one car for every seven people!

            <p>
Throughout the lifespan of the Toyota Corolla, one of the most commonly reported problems is excessive oil usage in the engine. This was more common in the 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2009 model years, though it did appear in other years such as 2014. Meanwhile, transmission problems plagued the 2003 and 2009 models.</p> <br>
